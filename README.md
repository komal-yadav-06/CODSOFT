**Titanic Survival Prediction**
Predicting survival on the Titanic using machine learning.

This beginner-friendly data science project uses the classic Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger survived the disaster. The dataset contains personal and travel details such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and port of embarkation.

📌 Project Goals
Understand and clean the Titanic dataset.

Explore patterns in survival rates.

Apply machine learning models for binary classification.

Evaluate and improve model performance.

📊 Dataset Features
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)

Sex: Gender of the passenger

Age: Age in years

SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard

Parch: Number of parents/children aboard

Fare: Ticket fare

Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

⚙️ Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

✅ Key Outcomes
Achieved ~82% accuracy using a Random Forest Classifier.

Identified top features influencing survival: Sex, Pclass, and Fare.

Cleaned and visualized the data for better insights.
